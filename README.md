# cpqr

cpqr transfers files between two computers.

This is a proof of concept of a method to transfer of data between two [air gapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)) computers. Typically, the source computer is a computer with a file that is displayed on the display as a sequence of QR codes and the target computer is a mobile device that records the sequence of QR codes, decodes it and saves the file once the transfer completes.

The following image summarizes the data flow starting with 1. a file existing on source device to be transferred, 2. QR code on the source device displayed in the show.html page, 3. a camera recording the displayed QR code is used on target device, and 4. when the complete file is received the file is saved at the target device.

## Try it

1. Set up the target device, which will use the camera to scan the sequence of QR codes.
 
   Open [scan.html](https://jmalenko.github.io/cpqr/scan.html) on a smartphone with camera. Point the camera at the screen of source computer and wait. Once the file is transferred, it will be saved.

2. On the source computer, which initially contains a file, show the sequence of QR codes that encode the file content.

   Open [show.html](https://jmalenko.github.io/cpqr/show.html), open a file to be transferred. The QR codes with file content will be displayed one by one.


## Design

The file to be transferred is split into data frames of fixed size (capacity parameter). Data frames are encoded as QR codes and displayed one by one on the source device. When the target device scans all the QR codes, it decodes them and reconstructs the file.

In addition, correction frames are generated by XOR of several data frames. Correction frames allow to recover lost data frames in case some QR codes are not scanned properly.
Correction frames are using Progressive Forward Error Correction (PFEC). That means that correction frames are generated continuously, with the increasing assumed loss rate. This allows to recover from various loss rates without knowing the loss rate in advance.

The file data is encoded as base64 to avoid problems with binary data in QR codes.


## Further development


1. Currently, correction frames are obtained by XOR of the data frames. Use an optimal correction algorithm by Reed-Solomon. An implementation is at https://github.com/ianopolous/ErasureCodes?tab=readme-ov-file .

2. On target, keep progress in a blob to improve reliability. The current limit for blob is 5 MB.
   
3. Transfer multiple files. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications .

4. On source, estimate the best parameters for QR density vs duration (for which one QR code is displayed).
